# Comparing AdGuard Home to other solutions

## How is this different from public AdGuard DNS servers?

Running your own AdGuard Home server allows you to do much more than using a public DNS server.

* Choose what exactly will the server block or not block.
* Monitor your network activity.
* Add your own custom filtering rules.
* TODO: Most importantly, this is your own server, and you are the only one who is in control.

In the future, AdGuard Home is supposed to become more than just a DNS server.

## How does AdGuard Home compare to traditional ad blockers

TBD

It depends. "DNS blackholing" is capable of blocking a big chunk of ads, but it lacks flexibility and power of the traditional ad blocking. A good example is [this article](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-vs-adaway-dns66/) that compares `AdGuard for Android` with hosts-level ad blockers. However, this level of protection is enough for some users.
